# Guinea-Spatial-Analysis-Population-Rainfall-Patterns

## Overview
This project integrates Guinea's administrative boundaries with 2025 population estimates and September 2025 rainfall data to analyze spatial relationships and support evidence-based decision making.

## Key Analyses Performed
- **Population-Rainfall Correlation**: Examined relationships between population density and precipitation patterns
- **Water Stress Assessment**: Identified regions at risk of water scarcity based on rainfall per capita
- **Vulnerability Mapping**: Created composite indices combining population density and rainfall deficiency
- **Infrastructure Prioritization**: Ranked districts for water infrastructure development
- **Regional Disparities**: Analyzed inequalities between administrative regions

## Key Findings
- Population distribution shows significant regional clustering
- Rainfall patterns vary substantially across administrative boundaries
- Several districts face high water stress despite adequate rainfall due to population pressure
- Clear prioritization emerged for infrastructure investment in high-risk areas

## Applications
The analysis supports:
- Climate adaptation planning
- Water resource management
- Infrastructure investment decisions
- Regional development policies
- Emergency preparedness strategies

## Data Sources
- Administrative boundaries from WHO shapefiles
- 2025 population estimates
- CHIRPS rainfall data (September 2025)

*Note: Systematic data validation ensured reliable integration despite initial inconsistencies in administrative naming conventions.*
